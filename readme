This is for notes and exercises from the 2nd edition of "Introduction to Computing Systems: from bits and gates to C and beyond" by Yale N. Patt and Sanjay J. Patel. 
I am working through this book as part of my effort to learn Computer Science outside of a university program. I discovered this book by way of recommendation from "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" by Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseau. 
Text files will be written and formated using markdown/latex and the exercises will be written formatted for the correct file type, whether for LC-3 instructions for the first half of the book and in C for the second half.
